# Binomial Tree Model for European Option Pricing

## Description
The goal of this project is to calculate option price for the **Binomial Tree model** and compare its convergence and error with the **Black-Scholes model**. Then, to select an option traded on NSE, using binomial tree model perform hedging analysis and analyse what contributed to the price change using Option Greeks.

## Tasks
- Implementation of the **Binomial Tree model** for pricing European options.
- Implementation of the **Black-Scholes model** for analytical option pricing.
- Visualization of option prices under different market conditions.
- Sensitivity analysis using **Greeks** (Delta, Theta, Gamma, Vega).
- Comparative study of the models' pricing accuracy.

## Methodology
- The **Binomial Tree model** prices an option by iteratively computing possible price movements over multiple time steps.
- The **Black-Scholes model** provides a closed-form solution for European option pricing based on continuous-time assumptions.
- The models are compared using different input parameters and market conditions.

## Results
- Visualizations compare the convergence of the Binomial Tree model to the Black-Scholes price as the number of steps increases.
- Sensitivity analysis showcases the effect of Greeks on option pricing.
